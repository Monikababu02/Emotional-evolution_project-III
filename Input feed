✅ Training Data Explanation:
python
Copy
Edit
X = np.array([
    [8, 4, 2],  # High stress, low sleep, low activity → Sad
    [6, 5, 3],  # Moderate stress/sleep/activity → Neutral
    [3, 7, 6],  # Low stress, good sleep/activity → Happy
    [2, 8, 7]   # Very low stress, great sleep/activity → Happy
])
y = np.array([0, 1, 2, 2])
Each list inside X is a daily record:

stress_level

sleep_hours

activity_level

And the y labels are:

0 → Sad

1 → Neutral

2 → Happy

✅ Prediction Input:
python

future_input = np.array([[5, 6, 4]])
This means:

Stress level: 5 (moderate)

Sleep: 6 hours

Activity level: 4 (moderate)
